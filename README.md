# MobiTurmix

MobiTurmix (mobiturmix.com)  was a personal project I developed and launched in early 2007 outside of my daily work, during nights and weekends. It is a web site plus a transcoding platform written entirely in PHP to allow internet users to upload all kind of media files (photos, videos, audio or animated gifs) and later download to their mobile phones via SMS WAP-Push.

Technologies used: GNU/Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL, git, ffmpeg, ImageMagick, WURFL, WAP.
